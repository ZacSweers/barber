Change Log
==========

Version 1.4.0 *In progress*
----------------------------

* New project structure. 
  * Doesn't require any changes existing gradle configurations.
  * API is now a normal AAR, which means support annotations and consumer proguard rules!
  * API and compiler now have no direct interdependence, just a shared internal "barber-annotations" module.
* More memory-efficient WeakArraySet implementation to handle view inheritance.
* Switched to full mavencentral releasing structure. This means artifacts will only be pushed to mavencentral.
  * It's just easier for me this way, the bintray-release plugin was causing trouble all the time
  * This also means snapshots!

Version 1.3.1 *2015-7-3*
----------------------------

* Hotfix for the barber-compiler pom not specifying the correct artifactId. Should be able to 
properly resolve the dependency now

Version 1.3.0 *2015-7-3*
----------------------------

This release adds support for specifying default values in `@StyledAttr` annotations. 
They must point to a resource ID, and abide by the same conventions for type resolution as 
before regarding `Kind`.

```java
@StyledAttr(value = R.styleable.BarberView_animated, defaultValue = R.bool.animated_default)
public boolean isAnimated;
```

Version 1.2.1 *2015-5-2*
----------------------------

* Add mavencentral support and update some dependencies

Version 1.2.0 *2015-4-11*
----------------------------

This adds support for retrieving Android attribute values.
  
```java
@AndroidAttr("textAllCaps")
public boolean textAllCaps;
```

Like `StyledAttr`, the default behavior is to return the type of the field/param. These are also subject to the same approach as `@StyledAttr` regarding special return types. See the [AttrSetKind enum](https://github.com/hzsweers/barber/blob/master/api/src/main/java/io/sweers/barber/AttrSetKind.java) for a full list of supported types.

```java
@AndroidAttr(value = "textColor", kind = AttrSetKind.RESOURCE)
public int textColor;
```

Version 1.1.1 *2015-3-8*
----------------------------

* Adds support for Preferences styling by removing the hard View requirement in Barber.style(â€¦) 
methods. Now it simply takes in an Object, and will now work for preferences with custom attributes.

Version 1.1.0 *2015-3-6*
----------------------------

* Add support for @Required annotation
* Add support for inheritance (#5)

Version 1.0.1 *2015-3-3*
----------------------------

* Lower minSdkVersion to 14

Version 1.0.0 *2015-3-3*
----------------------------
